        <p>Cricket is my favorite hobby and a famous sport too. It makes me feel healthy, fit and a stronger person. It makes me feel confident and proud of what I am. I started playing cricket when I was a kid of 7 years old.At that time also I was a good player in comparison to the children of my age. May be because I love to play cricket and I play it too seriously focusing on each and every ball.

Like many other people in India I was also aspired to play for my country. My days were never complete without cricket I used to play with my friends after my school hours were over. I use my left hand to hold the bat & bowl the ball which many people found strange but I was comfortable playing. Later with time I learnt to play cricket well and started participating in my school teams. I was appreciated by the match viewers as I used to be the highest score holder of the match. I was identified as the best bowler of the Lawrence School (my school) at the age of 14 which was a great achievement for me and my parents in the year 2014.Our team is gradually growing day by day. We are playing many cricket matches at national level. My aim is to play internationally.</p>
